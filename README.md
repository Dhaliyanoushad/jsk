### Project Description
[A completely useless Malayalam meme‚Äìinspired web app that uncovers your true identity through a totally scientific 3-level process: a quiz, a chaotic mini-game, and an actual trained image classification model to decide if you‚Äôre a gunda or an orphan.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[‡¥ï‡µá‡¥∞‡¥≥‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥Æ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡µæ ‡¥Ö‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥•‡¥∞‡µã ‡¥ó‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥ï‡¥≥‡µã ?]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[‡¥Ö‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥•‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥£‡µã ‡¥ó‡µÅ‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥£‡µã ‡¥é‡¥®‡µç‡¥®‡µÅ‡¥≥‡µç‡¥≥ ‡¥§‡¥ø‡¥∞‡¥ø‡¥ö‡µç‡¥ö‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥µ‡µç ]

*The above image shows the preloader of our webapp*

![Screenshot2:quiz](public/images/quiz.jpeg)
*The image shows our quiz where based on the answers the user gave, the gunda or orphan scale updates  *

![Screenshot3:Trained Model](public/images/sura.jpeg)
*Here the user photo is uploaded and the trained model detects if the user is a gunda or an orphan*
